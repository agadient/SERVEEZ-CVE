This is the pre-0.2.0 THANKS file.

Here are listed all the hackers who helped creating this package:

Andreas Rottmann <a.rottmann@gmx.at> for contributing the "configurable
	type" idea and appropriate patches.  Also thanks for sending
	patches regarding Guile 1.7.x support and maintaining the Debian
	packages.

John Fitzgerald <webmaster@has.org.nz> for giving an idea about ASN.1
        (Abstract Syntax Notation One), PDUs (Protocol Data Units) and
        their representation as lists resulting in the "Binary Smob".
	Thanks for reviewing parts of the documentation and sending
	patches for it.

Martin Grabmueller <mgrabmue@cs.tu-berlin.de> for writing the initial
	version and continuing to accept bug reports and patches for
        Sizzle, which we were using for configuration file parsing.
	Thanks for giving information about how to embed Guile into
	Serveez and use it as configuration file parser.
	Also for implementing the Guile servers and helping to convince
	the Guile people to keep the Guile distribution portable to Win32.

Martin Rother <m.rother@berlin.de> for supplying working M$-Windows
	installations (2k, NT and 98) and testing on these platforms.

This is the initial THANKS file written by Martin Grabmueller:

Raimund Jacob <raimi@lkcc.org> for a patch that made the whole
	beast work, and for heavy debugging and testing.  Also for
	brave diff'ing Stefan's and his patches.
	Kudos for the Cygwin port go to both Raimi and Stefan.
	Thanks also for bugging me to keep this stuff up.

Stefan Jahn <stefan@lkcc.org> for debugging and trying
	this crap under Cygwin.  Also for finding the weird ‘accept’
	bug and submitting a patch for it.
	For speeding up request handling and bug hunting.
	Kudos for the Cygwin port go to both Stefan and Raimi.
